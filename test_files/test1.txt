there
have
been
two
major
milestones
in
narcissistic
photography
in
the
last
century
the
first
was
the
invention
of
the
self
timer
which
kodak
began
selling
during
world
war
i
the
second
came
a
few
years
ago
as
teenagers
stood
at
mirrors
taking
pictures
of
themselves
with
camera
phones
to
share
online
the
camera
phone
is
perfect
for
the
social
networking
era
but
even
smartphones
have
a
limitation
you
need
to
hold
them
as
the
smartphone
has
pushed
some
camera
companies
off
a
cliff
a
tiny
ultrahigh
resolution
camera
that
can
record
that
very
feat
has
taken
off
into
the
stratosphere
figuratively
and
literally
the
gopro
which
costs
200
to
400
was
mounted
on
felix
baumgartner
as
he
sky
dived
24
miles
it
has
been
affixed
to
jets
traveling
at
mach
5
and
surfboards
sent
down
100
foot
waves
as
other
companies
have
sunk
gopro
has
sold
three
million
cameras
in
three
years
the
market
research
firm
idc
says
that
makes
the
gopro
the
most
popular
video
camera
in
the
country
last
week
the
company
which
began
10
years
ago
with
a
disposable
camera
strapped
to
surfers
wrists
unveiled
the
hero
3
you
might
think
a
product
announcement
from
a
camera
company
would
feel
like
a
funeral
shortly
before
the
person
was
going
to
die
but
it
felt
more
like
a
celebration
for
someone
who
was
going
to
live
forever
big
wave
surfers
those
who
ride
80
foot
waves
for
fun
showed
their
gopro
shots
to
sky
divers
who
in
turn
had
their
own
stories
to
show
how
did
this
happen
nick
woodman
the
founder
and
inventor
of
gopro
says
right
place
right
time
it
was
almost
that
simple
mr
woodman
37
made
the
first
crude
gopro
when
he
went
to
indonesia
on
a
surfing
trip
he
wanted
to
take
pictures
of
a
friend
in
the
water
but
when
he
turned
the
camera
around
to
take
pictures
of
himself
he
realized
the
companys
potential
the
big
aha
moment
was
in
2007
when
we
realized
the
bigger
opportunity
wasnt
just
making
wearable
cameras
for
photographers
mr
woodman
said
it
was
making
wearable
cameras
for
people
to
photograph
themselves
this
was
happening
just
as
google
was
buying
youtube
and
sites
like
twitter
and
facebook
were
going
mainstream
mr
woodman
began
selling
inexpensive
mounts
that
could
attach
the
gopro
to
anything
surfboards
bicycles
helmets
body
harnesses
cats
you
name
it
what
happened
next
was
astounding
people
started
to
develop
a
relationship
with
gopro
one
of
the
magical
things
that
started
happening
with
the
company
was
our
customers
felt
compelled
to
give
us
credit
in
their
photos
and
videos
mr
woodman
said
people
would
upload
videos
to
youtube
saying
me
and
my
gopro
going
sky
diving
you
certainly
dont
see
people
uploading
videos
that
say
check
out
my
sony
cyber
shot
ski
vacation
a
search
on
youtube
for
gopro
nets
more
than
half
a
million
videos
millions
of
photos
and
videos
litter
social
networking
sites
all
tagged
with
the
cameras
name
in
the
same
way
people
highlight
their
friends
now
the
appeal
is
moving
beyond
extreme
sports
enthusiasts
whose
idea
of
fear
is
sitting
in
a
cubicle
to
the
people
who
sit
in
cubicles
watching
gopro
videos
the
big
camera
companies
are
trying
to
displace
gopro
but
they
may
be
a
decade
too
late
for
the
last
50
years
companies
like
nikon
and
canon
have
been
focused
on
precision
which
has
its
benefits
but
also
has
its
limits
said
chase
jarvis
a
photographer
and
director
gopro
is
incredibly
disruptive
to
these
legacy
camera
makers
and
i
can
tell
you
their
launch
parties
feel
a
little
bit
different
they
are
from
a
different
culture
